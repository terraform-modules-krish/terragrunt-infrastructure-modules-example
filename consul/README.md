# Consul Example

This is an example of how to deploy the [Consul module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/hashicorp/consul/aws/0.0.5) 
from the Terraform Registry. See the [root README](https://github.com/terraform-modules-krish/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example/blob/v0.0.2/README.md) for instructions on how to run this example code. 

Note: This code is meant solely as a simple demonstration of how to lay out your files and folders with 
[Terragrunt](https://github.com/terraform-modules-krish/terragrunt) in a way that keeps your [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) 
code DRY. This is not production-ready code, so use at your own risk.
