# Changelog


# v0.7.0
_Released Feb 21, 2022_

## Description
**Terraform 1.1 upgrade**: We have verified that this repo is compatible with Terraform `1.1.x`! 
  - From this release onward, we will only be running tests with Terraform `1.1.x` against this repo, so we recommend updating to `1.1.x` soon! 
  - We have also updated the minimum required version of Terraform to `1.0.0`. While our repos might continue to be compatible with pre-1.0.0 version of Terraform, we are no longer making any guarantees of that.
  - Once all Gruntwork repos have been upgraded to work with `1.1.x`, we will publish a migration guide with a version compatibility table and announce it all via the Gruntwork Newsletter.
