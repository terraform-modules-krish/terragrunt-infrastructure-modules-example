# Fix or remove CircleCI build

**ina-stoyanova** commented *Feb 21, 2022*

Currently we've got a Github check running the project in CircleCI, but we don't actually have it configured. As part of this issue, we should:

- make a decision if we want a CircleCI pipeline to run - e.g. some terraform validate steps, or some other relevant steps
if yes, then add a configuration file & make sure it passes
- if no, then disable this check for the project from CircleCI [here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-modules-example/5/workflows/038dc15a-3230-478f-bb8b-52b50ff5e8aa/jobs/5)
Why?
Currently, some PRs will appear with a broken build because of the missing CircleCI configuration. This is not a big problem, so this task is more a housekeeping type of job.
