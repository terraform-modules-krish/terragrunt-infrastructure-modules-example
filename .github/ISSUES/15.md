# Please add a new release - currently broken with terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example

**darpham** commented *Jun 6, 2020*

Hello TerraGrunts,

I noticed while trying to git the [live example](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example) up, it's not pulling the latest commits and unfortunately causes errors with terragrunt.

There are some problems with the configuration, described below.

```
The Terraform configuration must be valid before initialization so that
Terraform can determine which modules and providers need to be installed.

Error: Duplicate backend configuration

  on main.tf line 15, in terraform:
  15:   backend "s3" {}

A module may have only one backend configuration. The backend was previously
configured at backend.tf:3,3-15.


Error: Duplicate provider configuration

  on provider.tf line 2:
   2: provider "aws" {

A default (non-aliased) provider configuration for "aws" was already given at
main.tf:9,1-15. If multiple configurations are required, set the "alias"
argument for alternative configurations.
