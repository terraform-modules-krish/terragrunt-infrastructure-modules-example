# Explanation of monorepo vs. polyrepo

**tillig** commented *Dec 2, 2019*

Showing live modules in a monorepo format indirectly indicates there's some sort of guidance or technical reason behind that choice. Based on #8 it sounds like this is more a choice that the team should make based on tooling and so on. This update adds a section to the README that explains that, while this example is a monorepo, there are benefits and drawbacks to that approach that need to be weighed.

Also included are some minor markdown formatting fixes based on markdownlint recommendations (e.g., removing trailing whitespace, adding language identifiers to fenced code blocks).

Re: line endings... it's not a CRLF/LF issue, it's that the original README has a lot of lines that have trailing whitespace:

![trailing_spaces](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1156571/70071388-2950b480-15aa-11ea-9fe8-154a4a0d7441.jpg)

It seemed reasonable to leave them removed. Tools like [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) catch this stuff and complain. Would it be better to submit lint/style fixes as a separate PR?

Yes plz! Unrelated changes should go into separate PRs.
