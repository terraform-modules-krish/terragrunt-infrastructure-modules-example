# Create initial version of example modules

**brikis98** commented *Jul 2, 2017*

This PR creates two modules:

* `asg-elb-service`: An example of how to deploy an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) in front of it. We run a dirt-simple "web server" on top of the ASG that always returns "Hello, World".
* `mysql`: An example of how to deploy MySQL on top of Amazon's Relational Database Service (RDS).  

Iâ€™ll submit another PR in the infra-live example repo that shows how these are used.
