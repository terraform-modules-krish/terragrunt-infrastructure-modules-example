# Pin Terraform and provider versions

**tillig** commented *Dec 2, 2019*

Based on guidance in _Terraform: Up & Running_ second edition, live modules should pin the versions of Terraform and the providers so testing and deployment are consistent; and to avoid deployment using a different Terraform version corrupting the state file.

This PR updates the live module example to be consistent with that so readers will see a "real" version of the thing about which they're reading.
