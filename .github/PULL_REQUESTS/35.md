# Data source: use aws_subnets over aws_subnet_ids

**rhoboat** commented *May 4, 2022*

## Description

Addresses _internal_ aws v4 compatibility.

This updates example code only. The provider version handles both old and new data sources, so users have no updates to make on their end as a result of this change. It is backward compatible. When we bump the provider version to at least 3.75 _and/or_ remove the 4.x lock, that's when we have a potential backward incompatibility, but most likely, even that update will be functionally backward compatible, i.e., only require an update to the provider version, and no config changes, imports, or state migrations.
