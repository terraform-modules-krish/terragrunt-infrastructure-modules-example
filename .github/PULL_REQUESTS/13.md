> Random thought: did we update the Terragrunt docs to recommend using generate instead of including an empty backend "s3" {...} block everywhere?

Not yet. This approach is documented, but is not documented as the recommended approach yet. We should probably do that at this point. The issue to track this work is https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt/issues/1054
