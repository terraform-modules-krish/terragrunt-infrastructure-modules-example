# Update 'engine_version' for MySQL

**mpuels** commented *Nov 22, 2018*

According to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_MySQL.html?shortFooter=true#MySQL.Concepts.VersionMgmt MySQL version 5.6.27 isn't supported anymore. Hence, `terragrunt apply` will exit with an error.

Glad I could help :) But don't you have to either 

1. create a new tag (e.g. v0.0.3) and update https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt-infrastructure-live-example/blob/97be88a78e2e42c38307c778467f72ad43ed53c8/non-prod/us-east-1/stage/mysql/terraform.tfvars#L11 accordingly or

2. update tag v0.0.1 (but tags should be immutable)?

Yes, if we were using this repo for any real-world use case, we would release a new tag. But this is just example code!

I know that this is just example code, but the next person trying to run the code on AWS will run into the same problem. It's your call. Either way, happy Thanksgiving :)
