# Update repo to work with Terraform 0.13.x

**robmorgan** commented *Sep 24, 2020*

This PR updates the repo to work with Terraform 0.13. Note: because this repo has examples of Terragrunt live infrastructure modules, I'm explicitly requiring TF `0.13.3` instead of simply pinning the version to `0.12.29`
